# My first project: Simple with drawbank account system.
 The system will ask for you to put your starting balance, then it will ask how much you want to withdraw. The system will stop and say goodbye after you type 0. You can only put numbers, having a letter will cause the system not to work
open ide program, enter your balance,  then enter how much you want to withdraw.
Example:
Enter Starting Balance:100
Enter amount to withdraw ( 0 to exit): 120
Not enough funds!
Enter amount to withdraw ( 0 to exit): 20
Withdrew: $ 20.0 Balance = $ 80.0
Enter amount to withdraw ( 0 to exit): 0
Goodbye!
